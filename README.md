# RunescapeBot
Runescape bot that fetches and stores public API data, and makes it readable through a discord bot.

I've only just started to learn python, this is my first project!

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
-  Superadmin functions (add/remove administrators).
-  Admin funcions (add/remove players to tracked lists).
-  Overall exp tracking over X time for all player for DXP events.

REQUIREMENTS
-  This bot requires a database to be set up locally, and several tables within said database. Table requirements will be added at a later stage.
